        <h2>Sheltie I</h2>
        <H3>Murphy</H3>
        <p>
            My wife adopted our dog Murphy in October of 2012.  She saw a picture of him online 
            and it was love at first sight.<br/><br/>She met Murphy at a local shelter 
            (<a href="https://www.sicsa.org/" target="_blank">SICSA</a>) 
            and brought him home that same day.<br/><br/>
            On the drive home, Murphy put his head in her lap. 
            It was love at first sight for him too. 
            <br/><br/>I first met Murphy in October of 2017 
            and we have been together ever since.

        <h2>Sheltie II</h2>
        <H3>Isabelle</H3>
        <p>
            My wife and I adopted Isabelle shortly after we became engaged and I moved back to Dayton (my home town) from Cincinnati.
            <br/><br/>We were interested in finding a playmate for Murphy, and he was so great we decided we needed another Sheltie.
            <br/><br/>We brought Izzy home in March of 2019, and she has been a source of enrichment (and trouble) ever since.
