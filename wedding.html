        <h3>Clark Sweet 2021!</h3>
        <p>
            My wife Jenn and I were married on 8/28/2021.<br/><br/>
            At least, that's when we had our <i>big</i> wedding...<br/><br/>
            Due to complications with the Covid-19 pandemic, we were legally married in my
            parents' backyard about a year earlier (on September 5, 2020), so we actually were married twice!
